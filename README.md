#### ASCVD Risk Calculator:

This **Risk Calculator** enables health care providers and patients to estimate **10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)**, defined as coronary death or nonfatal myocardial infarction, or fatal or nonfatal stroke, based on the [Pooled Cohort Equations and lifetime risk prediction tools](http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/129/25_suppl_2/S49.full.pdf).

The information required to estimate ASCVD risk includes `age`, `sex`, `race`, `total cholesterol`, `HDL cholesterol`, `systolic blood pressure`, `blood pressure lowering medication use`, `diabetes status`, and `smoking status`.
